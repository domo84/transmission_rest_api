# transmission_rest_api

For Transmission. A REST layer on top of RPC

There's nothing fancy about this. Just something I made in order to be able to use a RESTful approach when creating a new GUI.

You'll need to run it in parallel with `transmission` becuase it uses RPC as a data source. It's very much like a proxy.
